//! Integration test: sched profiler should only track worker threads, not blocking pool threads.
//!
//! Before the fix, every thread that started (including blocking pool threads) opened a
//! perf_event_open fd + 2 MB mmap ring buffer for sched event sampling. With Tokio's default
//! blocking pool limit of 512 threads, this could exhaust file descriptors.
//!
//! Additionally, `stop_tracking_current_thread` never cleaned up fds because `open_perf_event`
//! stored `tid: 0` (the "current thread" sentinel) while the cleanup searched for `gettid()`.
