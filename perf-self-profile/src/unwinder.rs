//! Framepointer-based stack unwinding
//!
//! This implementation uses a SIGSEGV fault handler to allow safe walking of stacks. Without

//!
//! Because of this, the unwinder must be "[`install`ed](Unwinder::install)" before
//! you can use it to [`capture`](Unwinder::capture) a stack.
//!
//! The unwound stacks are only addresses. You must use a symbolizer separately to
//! convert the addresses into function names.
