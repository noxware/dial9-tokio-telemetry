# dial9-trace-format Binary Specification

Version: 1

## Overview

A self-describing binary trace format. The stream is a sequence of frames preceded by a header. Schema frames describe event layouts; event frames carry data whose structure is defined by a previously-seen schema. String pool, stack pool, and timestamp reset frames provide auxiliary data.

All multi-byte integers are **little-endian** unless stated otherwise. Variable-length integers use **LEB128** encoding.

## Stream Layout

```
Header | Frame | Frame | Frame | ...
```

A valid stream starts with exactly one header, followed by zero or more frames. Frames may appear in any order, with one constraint: a schema frame for a given `type_id` **must** appear before any event frame that references that `type_id`.

## Header

| Offset | Size | Description                                  |
| ------ | ---- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 0      | 4    | Magic bytes: `0x54 0x52 0x43 0x00` (`TRC\0`) |
| 4      | 1    | Version (`0x01`)                             |

Total: **5 bytes**.

A decoder **must** reject streams whose magic bytes do not match or whose version is unsupported.

## Frames

Every frame begins with a 1-byte tag:

| Tag    | Frame Type         |
| ------ | ------------------ |
| `0x01` | Schema             |
| `0x02` | Event              |
| `0x03` | String Pool        |
| `0x04` | Stack Pool         |
| `0x05` | Timestamp Reset    |
| `0x06` | Schema Annotations |

Unknown tags **must** cause the decoder to stop (the stream cannot be advanced without knowing the frame size).

Frames may appear in any order, with one constraint: a schema frame for a given `type_id` **must** appear before any event frame that references that `type_id`.

### Schema Frame (`0x01`)

Defines the layout of an event type.

| Field         | Type                    | Description                                                        |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| tag           | u8                      | `0x01`                                                             |
| type_id       | u16                     | Unique event type identifier                                       |
| name_len      | u16                     | Length of name in bytes                                            |
| name          | [u8; name_len]          | UTF-8 event type name                                              |
| has_timestamp | u8                      | `1` if events of this type carry a packed timestamp, `0` otherwise |
| field_count   | u16                     | Number of fields                                                   |
| fields        | [FieldDef; field_count] | Field definitions (see below)                                      |

Each **FieldDef**:

| Field      | Type           | Description                      |
| ---------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| name_len   | u16            | Length of field name in bytes    |
| name       | [u8; name_len] | UTF-8 field name                 |
| field_type | u8             | Field type tag (see Field Types) |

A `type_id` **must not** be registered more than once in a stream with a different schema. Re-registering the same `type_id` with an identical schema is permitted (idempotent) and decoders **must** accept it.

The `has_timestamp` flag indicates whether events of this type include a packed nanosecond timestamp in the event frame header. When set, the timestamp is encoded in the event header (see Event Frame) and is **not** included in the field list. The schema's `field_count` and `fields` describe only the non-timestamp payload fields.

### Event Frame (`0x02`)

Carries one event whose layout is defined by a previously-registered schema.

**Without timestamp** (`has_timestamp = 0`):

| Field   | Type | Description                                 |
| ------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------- |
| tag     | u8   | `0x02`                                      |
| type_id | u16  | References a schema's `type_id`             |
| values  | ...  | Field values, encoded in schema field order |

**With timestamp** (`has_timestamp = 1`):

| Field              | Type | Description                                                   |
| ------------------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| tag                | u8   | `0x02`                                                        |
| type_id            | u16  | References a schema's `type_id`                               |
| timestamp_delta_ns | u24  | Nanosecond delta from the current timestamp base (3 bytes LE) |
| values             | ...  | Field values, encoded in schema field order                   |

The `timestamp_delta_ns` is a 24-bit unsigned integer (0–16,777,215) representing nanoseconds elapsed since the current timestamp base. This gives ~16.7 ms of range per reset. The encoder **must** emit a Timestamp Reset frame before any event whose delta would exceed 16,777,215 ns or whose timestamp is earlier than the current base.

Each event's absolute timestamp is computed as `base + delta_ns`. After decoding a timestamped event, the decoder **must** set `timestamp_base_ns = base + delta_ns` (i.e., advance the base to the event's absolute timestamp). This keeps inter-event deltas small, which is critical for compression.

The decoder **must** know the schema for `type_id` to determine how many fields to read and their types. If the schema is unknown, decoding **must** fail.

### String Pool Frame (`0x03`)

Provides string data that can be referenced by `PooledString` fields.

| Field   | Type               | Description              |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| tag     | u8                 | `0x03`                   |
| count   | u32                | Number of entries        |
| entries | [PoolEntry; count] | Pool entries (see below) |

Each **PoolEntry**:

| Field    | Type           | Description                                    |
| -------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| pool_id  | u32            | Identifier referenced by `PooledString` values |
| data_len | u32            | Length of data in bytes                        |
| data     | [u8; data_len] | UTF-8 string data                              |

Multiple string pool frames may appear in a stream. A `pool_id` should be defined before it is referenced, but a decoder may choose to resolve references lazily.

### Stack Pool Frame (`0x04`)

Provides stack-frame data that can be referenced by `PooledStackFrames` fields.

| Field   | Type                    | Description              |
| ------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| tag     | u8                      | `0x04`                   |
| count   | u32                     | Number of entries        |
| entries | [StackPoolEntry; count] | Pool entries (see below) |

Each **StackPoolEntry**:

| Field       | Type               | Description                                         |
| ----------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| pool_id     | u32                | Identifier referenced by `PooledStackFrames` values |
| frame_count | u32                | Number of stack frame addresses                     |
| frames      | [u64; frame_count] | Frame addresses, leaf-first, u64 LE                 |

Multiple stack pool frames may appear in a stream. A `pool_id` should be defined before it is referenced, but a decoder may choose to resolve references lazily.

### Timestamp Reset Frame (`0x05`)

Resets the running timestamp base used for packed event timestamps. The encoder emits this frame when the nanosecond delta between the current base and the next event's timestamp exceeds what a u24 can represent (16,777,215 ns ≈ 16.7 ms), or when the next event's timestamp is earlier than the current base.

| Field        | Type | Description                       |
| ------------ | ---- | --------------------------------- |
| tag          | u8   | `0x05`                            |
| timestamp_ns | u64  | Absolute timestamp in nanoseconds |

Total: **9 bytes**.

After decoding this frame, the decoder sets `timestamp_base_ns = timestamp_ns`. The next event's `timestamp_delta_ns` is relative to this new base.

### Schema Annotations Frame (`0x06`)

Carries per-field metadata for a previously-registered schema. Annotations are key-value string pairs attached to individual fields by index. A schema with no annotations produces no annotation frame.

| Field   | Type                     | Description                                                                          |
| ------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| tag     | u8                       | `0x06`                                                                               |
| type_id | LEB128 u64               | References a schema's `type_id` (varint-encoded to allow future overflow beyond u16) |
| count   | u16                      | Number of annotation entries                                                         |
| entries | [FieldAnnotation; count] | Annotation entries (see below)                                                       |

Each **FieldAnnotation**:

| Field       | Type            | Description                                  |
| ----------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| field_index | u16             | Index into the schema's field list (0-based) |
| key_len     | u16             | Length of key in bytes                       |
| key         | [u8; key_len]   | UTF-8 annotation key (e.g. `metrique.unit`)  |
| value_len   | u32             | Length of value in bytes                     |
| value       | [u8; value_len] | UTF-8 annotation value (e.g. `microseconds`) |

Multiple annotation frames for the same `type_id` are permitted; the decoder accumulates entries. The encoder typically emits one annotation frame immediately after the schema frame it annotates, but the format does not mandate ordering beyond the requirement that the referenced `type_id` must already be registered.

A decoder that encounters an annotation frame referencing an unknown `type_id` may skip it leniently (the annotations have nowhere to attach).

Annotation keys and values are free-form at the wire level. By convention, the `unit` key carries a field's unit; the values the viewer recognizes for human-friendly rendering are `ns`, `us`, `ms`, `s`, and `bytes` (the same set the `#[traceevent(unit = "...")]` derive attribute accepts at compile time). Unrecognized values render as the raw number.

| 15  | DynamicMap        | u32 count + count × (u8 key_tag + key + u8 value_tag + value)           | variable    |

### Optional Field Modifier (`0x80`)

The high bit of the field type tag is reserved as an "optional" modifier. When set, the field is preceded by a 1-byte presence prefix in the event data:

- `0x00`: field is absent (no further bytes for this field)
- `0x01`: field is present (followed by the inner type's normal encoding)

The inner type tag is `tag & 0x7F`. For example, tag `0x87` is an optional `PooledString` (tag 7 | 0x80).

In the schema frame, the `field_type` byte carries the optional bit. A decoder that does not recognize the modified tag (i.e., does not support optional fields) **must** reject the schema, since it cannot determine the field's wire size.

Optional fields serve two purposes: they allow event schemas to evolve without breaking backwards compatibility (a reader compiled with knowledge of a field that the writer omitted can default it to "absent" by checking the schema's field names), and they reduce wire size for values that are frequently absent (1 byte instead of the full inner type encoding).

### Timestamp Encoding

Events with timestamps use the packed header encoding:

1. The schema declares `has_timestamp = 1`.
2. The encoder maintains a `timestamp_base_ns` (initially 0).
3. For each event with a timestamp:
   a. Compute `delta_ns = timestamp_ns - timestamp_base_ns`.
   b. If `delta_ns > 16_777_215` (u24 max) or `timestamp_ns < timestamp_base_ns`, emit a **Timestamp Reset** frame with `timestamp_ns`, set `timestamp_base_ns = timestamp_ns`, and set `delta_ns = 0`.
   c. Write the 3-byte `delta_ns` as u24 LE in the event frame header.
   d. Set `timestamp_base_ns = timestamp_ns` (advance the base to this event's timestamp).
4. Decoding: `timestamp_ns = timestamp_base_ns + delta_ns`, then set `timestamp_base_ns = timestamp_ns`.

The base advances after every timestamped event so that deltas represent inter-event gaps rather than offsets from a distant base. This keeps deltas small and repetitive, which compresses well.

### StackFrames Encoding

Stack frame addresses are stored as raw little-endian u64 values:

1. Write `count` as u32 (number of addresses).
2. For each address (in order), write the address as **u64 LE** (8 bytes).

### PooledStackFrames Encoding

A `PooledStackFrames` field is encoded as a u32 LE pool ID (4 bytes) referencing a `StackPoolEntry` from a previously-emitted **Stack Pool Frame** (`0x04`). The encoder deduplicates identical stack traces into the pool; the same pool ID may be referenced by many events, which is the primary size win for high-frequency CPU sampling.

Decoders **must** resolve the pool ID against the accumulated stack pool to recover the addresses. A reference to an undefined `pool_id` is a stream error.

### StringMap Encoding

A string map carries an ordered list of key-value pairs (both UTF-8 strings):

1. Write `count` as u32 (number of pairs).
2. For each pair, write `key_len` as u32, then key bytes, then `val_len` as u32, then value bytes.

### DynamicList Encoding

A self-describing list where each element carries its own type tag:

1. Write `count` as u32 (number of elements).
2. For each element, write the element's field type tag as u8, then encode the element value according to that tag.

Elements may be heterogeneous (different types in the same list). Nested containers are supported: an element tag of `0x0E` (DynamicList) or `0x0F` (DynamicMap) is followed by the recursive encoding of that container.

### DynamicMap Encoding

A self-describing map where each entry carries type tags for both key and value:

1. Write `count` as u32 (number of entries).
2. For each entry, write the key's field type tag as u8, encode the key value, then write the value's field type tag as u8, encode the value.

Entries may be heterogeneous. Both keys and values can be any field type including nested containers.

### LEB128

**LEB128 (Little Endian Base 128)**: Variable-length integer encoding. Each byte encodes 7 bits of the value; the MSB is a continuation bit. A `u64` requires at most 10 bytes.
