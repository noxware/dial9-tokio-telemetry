# Memory Profiling

## Overview

Add sampled allocation profiling to dial9. A `Dial9Allocator<A>` wraps any
`GlobalAlloc` (default `System`) and emits `AllocEvent` / `FreeEvent` events
into the trace on sampled allocations. Stacks are captured via the frame
pointer unwinder already used for CPU profiling. The viewer and analysis
toolkit gain allocation flamegraphs, per-task allocation totals, and leak
detection.

The hot path on the allocating thread is **bare bones**: sample decision,
stack capture, push a fixed-size POD record into a process-global lock-free
queue. A dedicated **consolidator thread** drains the queue and turns each
record into the corresponding trace event. This keeps the allocator hook
allocator-quiet by construction and lets the consolidator use ordinary
`HashMap`/encoder machinery without re-entering the hook.

The design mirrors jemalloc's and Go's allocation profilers: **geometric
(Poisson) sampling** keyed on allocation size. The expected sampling rate
is 1 sample per N bytes allocated, regardless of object size distribution.
This gives unbiased size-weighted profiles at bounded overhead.

**Why not delegate to jemalloc's built-in profiling?** Our wrapper works
with *any* `GlobalAlloc` (system, jemalloc, mimalloc), integrates directly
into the dial9 trace (same timeline, same viewer, same task attribution),
and reuses the existing frame-pointer unwinder. Tradeoff: no access to
allocator internals (bin sizes, arena stats) — for that, use jemalloc's
`prof` directly.

## Goals

- Always-on in production, with sub-1% overhead at default sampling rates.
- Works with any `GlobalAlloc` (system, jemalloc, mimalloc, etc.) via a
  zero-cost wrapper.
- Stacks tied to the worker thread + task that performed the allocation, so
  allocation hot paths can be attributed to specific tasks or poll ranges.
- Optional live-set tracking for leak detection. Off by default — it
  adds an extra ring push per dealloc and a per-sample lookup on the
  consolidator side.
- No symbolication on the hot path. Addresses flow through the existing
  background `SymbolizeProcessor`.
- **Install-once, captured handle.** `MemoryProfiler::install(handle)`
  sets a process-global static that the allocator reads. The captured
  handle routes all sampled events through the central recorder.
- **Instruments all threads**, not just tokio workers — allocations on
  tokio workers, blocking pool, user OS threads, and library-spawned
  threads are all recorded identically.
- **Viewer and analysis toolkit support.** Allocation flamegraphs,
  per-task allocation totals, and leak detection views ship alongside
  the backend instrumentation.

## Non-goals

- Tracking every allocation. We sample.
- Replacing heaptrack / valgrind. Those record every allocation and are
  fine for dev-time analysis. Dial9 is for production, always-on.
- Detecting use-after-free, double-free, or other memory safety bugs.
  That's what Miri and ASAN are for.
- **Inspecting memory contents.** We record size, address, and stack —
  never the bytes stored in the allocation. No PII/secret leakage risk.
- **Cryptographic randomness.** The per-thread RNG is a fast PRNG
  (SplitMix64) seeded from a user-supplied or random seed. It is not
  cryptographically secure and doesn't need to be.
- Tracking stack allocations or `mmap`-backed memory outside the
  allocator. **Evolution path:** once the core allocator profiling is
  stable, we can add `mmap`/`munmap` interception to cover large
  anonymous mappings that bypass the allocator.

## 1. Geometric sampling

Per-thread byte counter `next_sample_bytes`. On every allocation of size
`s`:

```rust
fn on_alloc(size: usize) {
    // i64: must be signed — subtracting a large `size` from a small
    // remaining counter saturates at i64::MIN rather than wrapping.
    let remaining = next_sample_bytes.get().saturating_sub(size as i64);
    if remaining > 0 {
        next_sample_bytes.set(remaining);
        return;               // fast path: one sub, one branch, done
    }

    // Sampled. Draw a fresh gap to the next sample. We deliberately do
    // NOT loop to "consume" the deficit when one allocation overshoots
    // by more than one draw's worth — see "Why a single fresh draw"
    // below.
    next_sample_bytes.set(next_gap(rng, sample_rate_bytes));

    record_sample(size, capture_stack());
}

fn next_gap(rng: &mut SplitMix64, sample_rate_bytes: u64) -> i64 {
    // `sample_rate_bytes == 1` is the magic "sample every allocation"
    // mode: returning 0 makes the next decision (`counter - size`) go
    // ≤ 0 for any positive `size`, triggering a sample without
    // consulting the PRNG. Avoids ~63% per-alloc sampling at
    // `size = 1, rate = 1` due to the exponential's variance around
    // its mean. `0` is rejected at config build time, so this branch
    // only ever sees values `>= 1`.
    if sample_rate_bytes == 1 {
        return 0;
    }
    rng.draw_exponential(sample_rate_bytes) as i64
}
```

Two important details:

- `remaining` must be `i64` (signed). Subtracting `usize` from `usize`
  and comparing to zero invites wraparound bugs.
- `sample_rate_bytes == 1` is the magic "sample every allocation"
  short-circuit. The PRNG is bypassed; every call to the allocator is
  recorded. Matches user intuition: a rate of "1 byte between samples"
  means every byte is sampled, which for any allocation ≥ 1 byte means
  every allocation samples. `0` is rejected at config build time
  because it is ambiguous (sample everything? sample nothing?) — pass
  `1` for the explicit "sample everything" mode.

### Why a single fresh draw (no redraw loop)

A naive implementation handles the "sampled" branch by looping:

```rust
let mut next = remaining;       // negative for huge alloc + tiny rate
while next <= 0 {
    next += draw_exponential(sample_rate_bytes);
}
```

This is the textbook way to keep Poisson-process semantics: each draw is
a gap to the next event, so when an allocation spans multiple events the
PRNG must advance by the right number of draws.

But it's a footgun. With `sample_rate_bytes = 1` and a 1 GiB allocation,
`next ≈ -1e9` and the loop calls `draw_exponential` ~1 billion times —
~10 seconds inside the allocator hook holding the TLS RefCell.

We don't need it. Each `RawAlloc` carries its own `size` field, so
downstream rate estimators weight samples by the bytes they represent.
The number of samples emitted per allocation is capped at one regardless
of how the counter is replenished. By the strong law of large numbers, a
single fresh draw on each sample produces the same long-run sampling
probability per allocation — `1 - exp(-size / mean)` — as the looping
variant. The `next_gap` helper makes this explicit and preserves the
single-allocation worst case at O(1) PRNG work.

Default `sample_rate_bytes = 512 KiB`. At that rate, a service doing 1 GB/s
of allocation generates ~2000 samples/sec — plenty of signal, trivial
overhead.

### RNG

**Per-thread RNG in TLS, not process-global.** A shared `AtomicU64` would
force a read-modify-write across threads on every allocation; TLS gives
each thread its own state with a plain load/store.

**Reuse the existing `SplitMix64` and `draw_exponential` from
`task_dumped.rs`**, extracted into a shared `pub(crate)` module
(e.g. `dial9-tokio-telemetry/src/sampling.rs`). The shape is identical —
only the unit changes (`bytes` instead of `nanoseconds`). Shared API:

```rust
// dial9-tokio-telemetry/src/sampling.rs
pub(crate) struct SplitMix64(u64);

impl SplitMix64 {
    pub(crate) fn new(seed: u64) -> Self;
    pub(crate) fn next_u64(&mut self) -> u64;
    /// Draw from exponential distribution with the given mean.
    /// Always returns at least 1 to avoid immediate re-trigger.
    pub(crate) fn draw_exponential(&mut self, mean: u64) -> i64;
}
```

Memory profiling stores per-thread state in TLS:

```rust
thread_local! {
    static SAMPLE_STATE: Cell<SamplingState> = Cell::new(
        SamplingState::new(global_seed().wrapping_add(thread_nonce()))
    );
}

struct SamplingState {
    next_sample_bytes: i64,
    rng: SplitMix64,
}
```

Each thread seeds its state lazily on first sample from a shared
install-time seed mixed with a per-thread nonce (e.g.
`ThreadId::as_u64()` or a counter), so the stream is deterministic
given `rng_seed` and reproducible across runs for tests.

Short-lived threads that never sample pay zero: `thread_local!`
initializers don't run until the first access.

### Why geometric over alternatives

Unbiased estimates of total bytes allocated per call site. Reservoir
sampling biases against allocations that occur late in a program's
lifetime. Fixed N-of-every-M biases against large objects that get
undersampled. Per-byte Bernoulli sampling via the geometric/exponential
trick gives the lowest variance estimator of the simple strategies.

### Estimating totals from samples

> **Read this before consuming `AllocEvent.size`.** The raw `size` field
> on a sampled event is the bytes of *that one* allocation, not a
> scaled estimate. Summing raw sizes will undercount allocations
> dominated by small objects, often dramatically (orders of magnitude
> for tiny allocations).

Each sampled allocation of size `s` survives Poisson sampling with
probability:

```
P(sample | size = s) = 1 - exp(-s / R)
```

where `R` is `sample_rate_bytes`. The Horvitz–Thompson estimator
weights each sample by the inverse of its sampling probability. To
recover the total bytes allocated through a code path:

```
total_bytes ≈ Σ over sampled events  s_i / (1 - exp(-s_i / R))
```

To recover the total *count* of allocations:

```
total_count ≈ Σ over sampled events       1 / (1 - exp(-s_i / R))
```

#### Two regimes, one formula

The same formula handles both extremes correctly:

| Allocation size | `1 - exp(-s/R)` | Per-sample byte weight |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| `s << R` (tiny) | `≈ s / R`       | `s / (s/R) = R`          |
| `s ≈ R`         | `≈ 0.63`        | `s / 0.63 ≈ 1.58 s`      |
| `s >> R` (huge) | `≈ 1`           | `s / 1 = s`              |

So a tiny sample contributes one full `R` worth of bytes to the
estimate; a huge sample contributes its actual size.

#### Worked example

At `sample_rate_bytes = 512` and `total_allocated = 1 MiB` (= 1 048 576 B),
the same total can be reached via radically different size
distributions and the unbiased estimator recovers ~1 MiB in every case
(figures from `unbiased_estimator_recovers_total_bytes_across_strategies`):

| Strategy             | # allocs | # samples | Σ raw sizes | HT estimate | Rel. error |
|----------------------|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| 1 B × 1 048 576      | 1 048 576 | 2 040     | 2 040 B     | 1 045 500 B | 0.29% |
| 64 B × 16 384        | 16 384   | 1 919     | 122 816 B   | 1 045 215 B | 0.32% |
| 1 024 B × 1 024      | 1 024    | 890       | 911 360 B   | 1 054 004 B | 0.52% |
| 64 KiB × 16          | 16       | 16        | 1 048 576 B | 1 048 576 B | 0.00% |
| 1 MiB × 1            | 1        | 1         | 1 048 576 B | 1 048 576 B | 0.00% |

The naive **`Σ raw sizes`** column varies from 2 KiB to 1 MiB across
strategies — three orders of magnitude — even though every strategy
allocated the same 1 MiB total. Always apply the inverse-probability
weight before aggregating.

#### Aggregation order matters

When grouping by call site / task / type, **weight each sample
individually before summing**:

```
# CORRECT — unbiased:
for sample in stack_group:
    weight = 1.0 / (1.0 - exp(-sample.size / R))
    total_bytes += sample.size * weight

# WRONG — sum-then-unbias under-reports small-object stacks:
raw_sum = sum(sample.size for sample in stack_group)
mean_size = raw_sum / len(stack_group)
weight = 1.0 / (1.0 - exp(-mean_size / R))
total_bytes = raw_sum * weight  # ← biased
```

The right-hand version uses the group's *mean* size as if every
allocation in the group were that size; for skewed distributions this
can be off by orders of magnitude.

#### Where `R` comes from

`sample_rate_bytes` is set at install time on `MemoryProfilingConfig`
and is written into segment metadata as `memory.sample_rate_bytes`.
Analysis tooling reads it from `TraceReader::segment_metadata` (Rust)
or `trace.segmentMetadata` (JS). For traces recorded before this
field was added, fall back to the deployment's configured rate or the
default (512 KiB).

Always pull `R` from segment metadata rather than a build-time
constant — the default may change and operators may override it per
deployment.

#### `sample_rate_bytes == 1` ("sample every allocation")

In this magic mode every alloc is in the trace (`0` is rejected at
config build time, so the only way to get this behaviour is by
explicitly passing `1`). The raw `size` field is already the truth:
the HT formula still gives the right answer
(`exp(-s/1) ≈ 0` for any positive `s`, so the weight is ~1), but you
can short-circuit and just sum: `total_bytes = Σ s_i`,
`total_count = number of samples`.

## 2. Stack capture

The memory profiler uses the existing `Unwinder` (from
`dial9-perf-self-profile`) for stack capture. Key properties:

- **No allocations.** Captures into an on-stack `[u64; 128]` buffer.
- **Safe against corrupted frame chains** via the `safe_load` SIGSEGV
  handler (installed once at startup).
- **~5 ns per frame, ~110 ns for a 20-frame walk** on x86_64. Add
  ~50–200 ns in production for cold caches; faulting frames that hit
  the SIGSEGV safe-load path cost ~1–5 µs for the single faulting
  frame.
- **Requires frame pointers** (`-C force-frame-pointers=yes`).

`MemoryProfiler::install()` calls `Unwinder::install()` and stores the
returned handle. The hook accesses it via the process-global
`MemoryProfilerInner`:

```rust
// 128 frames × 8 B = 1 KiB stack buffer. Rust async call stacks
// routinely exceed 40 frames, so 128 gives comfortable headroom.
let mut frames = [0u64; 128];
let n = inner.unwinder.capture(&mut frames);
```

**Known limitation:** Applications that install their own SIGSEGV handler
after dial9 initialization may break the unwinder's fault tolerance.

---

## 3. Events

### `AllocEvent`

```rust
#[derive(TraceEvent)]
struct AllocEvent {
    #[traceevent(timestamp)]
    timestamp_ns: u64,
    /// OS thread ID. Matches CpuSample.tid.
    tid: u32,
    /// Allocation size in bytes.
    size: u64,
    /// Returned pointer. Only meaningful when liveset tracking is on —
    /// otherwise 0. Field always present so the schema is stable.
    addr: u64,
    /// Stack at the allocation site.
    stack: InternedStackFrames,
}
```

**Sampling rate in metadata, not per-event.** The sample rate is
immutable for the life of a trace file and is written into
`SegmentMetadata`:

```
SegmentMetadata["memory_profile.sample_rate_bytes"] = "524288"
```

The analysis toolkit reads `sample_rate_bytes` from segment metadata
and applies it uniformly to every `AllocEvent` when computing unbiased
byte totals. If we later want a `set_sample_rate_bytes` API, it will
atomically update the rate and force a segment rotation so the new
segment's metadata carries the new rate.

**Why explicit `tid`?** A trace can contain allocations from threads
that aren't inside a poll — blocking-pool workers, user-spawned OS
threads, early-boot allocations. `CpuSample` already carries `tid` for
the same reason; alloc events and CPU samples join cleanly on thread.

We **don't** carry a `worker_id`: when the alloc happens on a tokio
worker, the worker's identity is recoverable by joining `tid` to the
most recent `WorkerUnparkEvent.tid` ≤ `AllocEvent.timestamp_ns`. This
keeps the allocator hook decoupled from tokio runtime state.

> **Pre-requisite**: `WorkerParkEvent` / `WorkerUnparkEvent` must
> include `tid`. That's a small additive change to those event schemas.

### `FreeEvent` (liveset only)

```rust
#[derive(TraceEvent)]
struct FreeEvent {
    #[traceevent(timestamp)]
    timestamp_ns: u64,
    /// OS thread ID of the thread that ran the dealloc.
    tid: u32,
    /// Pointer that was freed. Matches a previously-seen `AllocEvent.addr`.
    addr: u64,
    /// Size of the allocation being freed.
    size: u64,
    /// Monotonic-ns timestamp of the original `AllocEvent`.
    alloc_timestamp_ns: u64,
}
```

**Why denormalize `size` and `alloc_timestamp_ns`?** `RotatingWriter`
evicts old segments. A long-lived allocation will have its `AllocEvent`
in a segment that has been evicted by the time its `FreeEvent` is
written. Denormalizing keeps `FreeEvent` self-sufficient for
net-bytes-freed and generational leak analysis across rotation.

We do **not** denormalize the allocation stack onto `FreeEvent`:
storing the full stack in every liveset entry would bloat the liveset
~8× and that memory is paid while the allocation is live.

### `realloc` handling

**Follow jemalloc's approach.** Treat `realloc(p, n_bytes)` as:
1. `dealloc(p, old_layout)` — may emit `FreeEvent` if `p` was sampled.
2. `alloc(new_layout)` — fresh sampling decision, may emit `AllocEvent`.

In-place realloc (pointer unchanged) still goes through the same flow.
Timestamps disambiguate the free-then-alloc of the same address.

### Worker / task attribution

Both events carry an implicit task_id via the shared `PollStart` context.
Every alloc inside a poll falls between that worker's most recent
`PollStart` and the matching `PollEnd`. The analysis toolkit already uses
this range-matching for CPU samples.

Allocations outside any poll carry only `tid` and get no task
attribution. The viewer shows these in a "blocking" or "unknown" lane.

---

## 4. `Dial9Allocator<A>`

Generic wrapper, default `A = System`:

```rust
pub struct Dial9Allocator<A = std::alloc::System>(A);

impl Dial9Allocator {
    pub const fn system() -> Self { Self(std::alloc::System) }
}

impl<A: GlobalAlloc> Dial9Allocator<A> {
    pub const fn new(inner: A) -> Self { Self(inner) }
}

unsafe impl<A: GlobalAlloc> GlobalAlloc for Dial9Allocator<A> {
    unsafe fn alloc(&self, layout: Layout) -> *mut u8 {
        let ptr = unsafe { self.0.alloc(layout) };
        if !ptr.is_null() {
            hook::on_alloc(ptr, layout.size());
        }
        ptr
    }

    unsafe fn dealloc(&self, ptr: *mut u8, layout: Layout) {
        hook::on_dealloc(ptr, layout.size());
        unsafe { self.0.dealloc(ptr, layout) };
    }

    unsafe fn realloc(
        &self, ptr: *mut u8, old_layout: Layout, new_size: usize
    ) -> *mut u8 {
        let new_ptr = unsafe { self.0.realloc(ptr, old_layout, new_size) };
        if !new_ptr.is_null() {
            // Only record the free-of-old after confirming realloc
            // succeeded. If realloc returns null, the old pointer is
            // still live and must not be recorded as freed.
            hook::on_dealloc(ptr, old_layout.size());
            hook::on_alloc(new_ptr, new_size);
        }
        new_ptr
    }
}
```

User code:

```rust
// Common case: system allocator.
#[global_allocator]
static ALLOC: Dial9Allocator = Dial9Allocator::system();

// Wrapping a custom allocator:
#[global_allocator]
static ALLOC: Dial9Allocator<tikv_jemallocator::Jemalloc> =
    Dial9Allocator::new(tikv_jemallocator::Jemalloc);
```

The wrapper is zero-cost when memory profiling isn't installed (see §6).

---

## 5. Ring-buffer architecture

The allocator hook does the **bare minimum** on the allocating thread —
sampling decision, stack capture, push a fixed-size POD record into a
lock-free queue. The existing **flush thread** (which already drains
`CpuProfiler` and `SchedProfiler`) picks up the memory profiler as
another `Source` and turns each record into the corresponding trace event.

**Why a ring buffer?** Everything an allocator hook touches must be
allocator-quiet. Encoders allocate. Concurrent hashmaps allocate.
`tracing::warn!` allocates. Each of those becomes a potential deadlock
or infinite recursion when run from inside `GlobalAlloc::alloc`. The
reentrancy concerns are trickier than they appear — TLS destruction
ordering, lock re-entry from encoder allocations, and epoch-reclamation
panics in concurrent data structures all create subtle hazards. A
ring-buffer hand-off eliminates the entire class by construction: the
hook never holds a lock, never calls into data structures with their own
TLS, and never grows a collection.

### Two queues

The design uses **two separate `ArrayQueue`s**:

1. **Alloc queue** — `ArrayQueue<RawAlloc>`, 4096 slots × ~520 B ≈ 2.1 MiB.
   Receives sampled allocations (large records with full stack frames).
2. **Free queue** — `ArrayQueue<RawFree>`, 32K slots × 24 B ≈ 768 KiB.
   Receives dealloc notifications (small records: addr + tid + timestamp).
   Only active when liveset tracking is on.

The size asymmetry reflects the traffic pattern: allocs are rare (sampled,
~2K/sec at default rate) but large (carry stack frames); frees are frequent
(every dealloc of a sampled pointer) but tiny.

### What the allocator hook does

1. Load process-global `OnceLock<MemoryProfilerState>`. Return early if unset.
2. Subtract `size` from the per-thread `next_sample_bytes` counter (~1 ns).
3. **Unsampled (~99.9% of allocs):** return.
4. **Sampled:**
   - `Unwinder::capture(&mut frames)` into an on-stack `[u64; 128]` (~110 ns).
   - Build a `RawAlloc { tid, size, ts_ns, addr, frames, frame_count }` on
     the stack.
   - `alloc_queue.push(sample)` — lock-free MPMC push (~10–30 ns uncontended).
   - On queue full: increment a dropped-samples counter, continue.

For deallocs (liveset on):
- Push `RawFree { tid, addr, ts_ns }` to the free queue (~9 ns uncontended).

No mutex. No encoder. No hashmap. No `Vec::with_capacity`.

### Consolidator (flush thread)

The flush thread drains both queues every 5 ms via the `Source` trait.
**Drain order: merge by timestamp** — peek both queues, pop whichever has
the older timestamp, repeat. This handles in-place realloc correctly
(free-of-old at T₁ must be processed before alloc-of-new at T₂ for the
same address).

For each `RawAlloc`:
1. Intern the stack via the flush thread's `ThreadLocalEncoder`.
2. Encode an `AllocEvent` into the trace.
3. If liveset is on, insert into the consolidator's `HashMap<usize, LivesetEntry>`.

For each `RawFree`:
1. Look up `addr` in the liveset `HashMap`. Hit → emit `FreeEvent`. Miss → ignore.

### Why `crossbeam_queue::ArrayQueue`

- Producers come from arbitrary threads. A per-thread SPSC ring would
  require per-thread setup that itself allocates.
- `ArrayQueue` is wait-free for `push` (CAS on a single tail slot index)
  and the workspace already depends on `crossbeam-queue`.
- At default 512 KiB sample rate and 1 GB/s allocation, the system pushes
  ~2K samples/sec — invisible contention even on 32 cores.

### Reentrancy

The flush thread's own allocations (interning stacks, growing the
encoder's hashmaps, inserting into the liveset) *do* trigger the hook.
This is fine and intentional:

- The hook on the flush thread does the same sampling decision as any
  other thread (~1 in 8000 allocs at default rate).
- Sampled allocations push a `RawAlloc` into the ring — the push is
  allocator-quiet, so it can't cascade.
- dial9's own allocation pressure shows up in the trace. If the profiler
  itself generates noticeable traffic, that's information we want. Filter
  `dial9_tokio_telemetry::*` frames at analysis time if needed.

**Geometric self-sampling is bounded.** The flush thread drains N samples,
encoding them does ~kN allocations, ~kN/8000 trip the sampler, producing
k²N/8000² second-order self-samples. The geometric series converges fast;
steady-state self-pollution is ~0.01% of trace events.

**Allocation during stack capture.** `Unwinder::capture()` never allocates —
it uses only the on-stack `[u64; 128]` buffer and the allocation-free
frame-pointer unwinder.

**Early-boot allocations.** Before `MemoryProfiler::install()`, the
`OnceLock` is unset and the hook returns early (~1 ns overhead).

---

## 6. Configuration — static install, captured handle

`MemoryProfiler::install()` sets a process-global static that the
`Dial9Allocator` reads on every allocation. Installation happens
**exactly once per process** and takes a `TelemetryHandle` captured
at install time.

### Shape

```rust
use dial9_tokio_telemetry::memory_profiling::{
    Dial9Allocator, MemoryProfiler, TimestampMode,
};

#[global_allocator]
static ALLOC: Dial9Allocator = Dial9Allocator::system();

fn main() {
    let guard = TelemetryCore::builder()
        .writer(writer)
        .trace_path("/tmp/trace.bin")
        .build()?;
    guard.enable();

    let _mem = MemoryProfiler::builder()
        .sample_rate_bytes(512 * 1024)
        .track_liveset(true)
        .timestamp_mode(TimestampMode::ReusePollStart)
        .install(guard.handle())?;

    let (rt, _) = guard.trace_runtime("main").build(rt_builder)?;
    rt.block_on(async { /* ... */ });
}
```

Between the global allocator static and `install()`, every allocation
takes the unset-`OnceLock` fast path: one `Acquire` load + null check
(~1 ns), not set → skip.

### Why capture the handle

There's one global allocator, allocations come from everywhere, and we
want *all* of them to land in the same trace. A single captured handle
achieves that — no `TelemetryHandle::current()` TLS lookup on the hot
path.

### `MemoryProfiler::install()` flow

```rust
static ACTIVE: OnceLock<MemoryProfilerState> = OnceLock::new();

impl MemoryProfiler {
    pub fn install(
        self,
        handle: TelemetryHandle,
    ) -> Result<MemoryProfilerGuard, InstallError> {
        let unwinder = Unwinder::install().map_err(InstallError::Unwinder)?;
        let alloc_ring = Arc::new(ArrayQueue::new(self.config.ring_capacity));
        let free_ring = Arc::new(ArrayQueue::new(self.config.ring_capacity * 8));

        let state = MemoryProfilerState {
            unwinder,
            config: self.config.clone(),
            alloc_ring: alloc_ring.clone(),
            free_ring: free_ring.clone(),
        };

        ACTIVE
            .set(state)
            .map_err(|_| InstallError::AlreadyInstalled)?;

        handle.register_source(MemoryProfileSource {
            alloc_ring,
            free_ring,
            liveset: self.config.track_liveset.then(HashMap::new),
        });

        Ok(MemoryProfilerGuard { _private: () })
    }
}
```

The state lives in `OnceLock` and is never reclaimed — in-flight hook
calls may be reading it at any moment on any thread. Cost is ~100 bytes
plus the ring allocations. The `OnceLock` encodes the "write once, read
many, never reclaim" invariant in the type system.

If `install()` is called with a disabled handle, the `OnceLock` is not
set — no wasted sampling work.

### Hot path

```rust
fn alloc(&self, layout: Layout) -> *mut u8 {
    let ptr = unsafe { self.0.alloc(layout) };
    if !ptr.is_null() {
        if let Some(state) = ACTIVE.get() {
            hook::on_alloc(state, ptr, layout.size());
        }
    }
    ptr
}
```

### `MemoryProfilingConfig`

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct MemoryProfilingConfig {
    sample_rate_bytes: u64,             // default 512 KiB
    track_liveset: bool,                // default false
    timestamp_mode: TimestampMode,      // default ReusePollStart
    max_liveset_entries: Option<usize>, // default None (unbounded)
    rng_seed: Option<u64>,              // test-only deterministic seeding
    ring_capacity: usize,              // default 4096 slots
}

/// How `AllocEvent.timestamp_ns` is populated.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq)]
#[non_exhaustive]
pub enum TimestampMode {
    /// Reuse the timestamp from the most recent `PollStart` on this
    /// thread when available (~2 ns TLS load). Falls back to
    /// `clock_monotonic_ns()` on threads with no recorded `PollStart`.
    /// Default.
    ReusePollStart,

    /// Emit events with `timestamp_ns = 0`. Smallest on-disk size.
    /// Analysis can still group by stack and size; loses time-range
    /// filtering.
    None,

    /// Call `clock_monotonic_ns()` per sampled allocation (~25 ns via
    /// vDSO). Use for tight allocation loop investigations.
    Precise,
}
```

Built via `#[bon::builder]` as with other dial9 configs.

### Graceful shutdown

On graceful shutdown, the flush thread runs one final drain cycle.
For applications that need the absolute last batch of events on disk:

```rust
guard.handle().flush_memory_profile()?;  // synchronous drain
guard.graceful_shutdown(Duration::from_secs(5))?;
```

---

## 7. Liveset tracking

When `track_liveset = true`, the **consolidator thread** maintains:

```rust
struct LivesetEntry {
    size: u64,
    timestamp_ns: u64,
}

// Single-threaded — only the consolidator reads or writes it.
liveset: HashMap<usize, LivesetEntry>,
```

The liveset is a plain `HashMap` because only the consolidator touches
it. Producers push `RawFree` records into the free queue and never
access the liveset directly — no synchronization needed.

### Bounded liveset

`max_liveset_entries` caps the total count. When full:
- New `RawAlloc`: still emit `AllocEvent`, skip liveset insert. Emit a
  rate-limited warning event (once per 60s).
- `RawFree`: still lookup (miss on overflow entries). No-op on miss.

Default: `None` (unbounded). Users opt in to a cap.

### Memory cost

~32 bytes per live sampled allocation (16 B entry + 16 B HashMap
overhead). At default 512 KiB sample rate and 1 GiB live heap: ~2K
entries → ~64 KiB. At 10 GiB live heap: ~20K entries → ~640 KiB.

### Dealloc overhead

Pushing `RawFree` records costs ~9.3 ns uncontended per dealloc. The
MPMC queue saturates at ~2.7 M pushes/sec aggregate under heavy
contention. For services with 10M+ deallocs/sec, a producer-side
optimization is needed:

- **Per-thread free buffer:** batch frees in a TLS `[RawFree; 64]`
  array; flush to the free queue every 64 frees. Converts 64 contended
  pushes into 1.
- **Producer-side bloom filter:** test whether the address was sampled
  (~5 ns hash + bit-check) before pushing; 99.9% of deallocs skip the
  push entirely.

Pick at implementation time based on whether production workloads show
actual contention. Consolidator-side `HashMap` miss for unsampled
addresses is ~10–20 ns — not worth optimizing until profiling shows
otherwise.

Liveset is off by default because even 9.3 ns per dealloc adds up on
dealloc-heavy workloads.

---

## 8. Overhead budget

Target: <1% at default settings (512 KiB sample rate, no liveset).

**Context:** A single `malloc`/`free` on modern allocators takes ~20-80 ns
uncontended. Our fast-path overhead (~1 ns) is well within the noise.

**Per-allocation fast path (unsampled, ~99.9% of calls):**
- 1 `OnceLock::get()` (Acquire load + null check, ~1 ns)
- 1 subtract + compare on per-thread `next_sample_bytes` (~1 ns)
- Total: **~1.1 ns**

For a service doing 1M allocs/sec: ~1 ms/sec of CPU per core (0.1%).

**Per-sampled allocation (~0.1% of calls):**
- Stack capture: ~110 ns (20 frames warm-cache; ~200–400 ns cold)
- Build `RawAlloc` on stack: ~30 ns
- `ArrayQueue::push`: ~50–100 ns uncontended
- Optional timestamp: ~25 ns (`TimestampMode::Precise`)
- Total: **~1226 ns** (dominated by stack capture)

At 2K samples/sec: ~2.5 ms/sec of CPU per core (0.25%).

**Dealloc (liveset on):** ~9.3 ns per dealloc uncontended.

### Integration benchmark

The implementation ships with a benchmark exercising the full
`Dial9Allocator → ring → consolidator → trace` pipeline:
- High-frequency small allocations (`Box::new(T)` loops)
- Realloc growth (`Vec::push` loops)
- Mixed sizes across the sample-rate boundary
- Comparison: (no profiler) vs (sampling only) vs (sampling + liveset)

## 9. Viewer changes

### Allocation flamegraph

Same UX as CPU flamegraph — click a poll, or shift-drag a time range,
see a flamegraph. Sample value is
`AllocEvent.size * weight_correction(AllocEvent.size, sample_rate)`,
where `sample_rate` is read from `SegmentMetadata`.

### Per-task allocation chart

For each task, total bytes allocated + sampled count. Sort by size;
shows leaky / hot tasks at a glance. Uses the same poll-range join the
viewer already does for `CpuSample`. Allocations with no containing
poll go into an "unassociated" bucket.

### Leak view (liveset only)

Show allocations with no matching free at end-of-trace, grouped by
stack, sorted by total bytes.

---

## 10. Analysis toolkit

Extend `dial9-viewer/skills/analyze.js` with:

- `allocationsByTask()` — groups by task, weighted.
- `topAllocationStacks(n)` — flamegraph-style stack aggregation, unbiased.
- `leakCandidates(minBytes)` — live allocations grouped by stack, above
  a threshold.

New skill doc: `dial9-viewer/skills/memory.md` covering recipes for
common questions ("what allocated the most bytes in this time range?",
"which stacks show the largest retained heap?", etc.).

---

## 11. Testing strategy

`MemoryProfiler::install` publishes a process-global `OnceLock` that is
never reclaimed. Tests that exercise different configurations each need
their own process. Use separate `tests/memory_profiling_*.rs` files —
`cargo nextest` runs each in its own process by default.

### Test categories

1. **Unit tests** (in-crate, no `install()`):
   - Empirical sampling rate matches target within ±10% over ≥10K
     simulated allocs.
   - `draw_exponential` distribution sanity (mean, variance).
   - Deterministic via `rng_seed`.
2. **Integration** (separate `tests/` files):
   - Alloc a known pattern, inspect the trace for expected events and
     approximate counts.
   - Verify `AllocEvent.tid` matches the allocating thread.
   - Verify stacks whose top frame matches the allocation callsite.
3. **Liveset** round-trip:
   - Alloc N, free M, verify liveset.len() == N - M.
   - Verify `FreeEvent.size` and `FreeEvent.alloc_timestamp_ns` match
     the original `AllocEvent`.
4. **Reentrancy:**
   - Record a tracing event whose subscriber allocates; confirm no
     infinite recursion.
5. **Realloc:**
   - Alloc, realloc to larger (in-place and moved), verify free-of-old
     + alloc-of-new per jemalloc rules.
6. **Rotation robustness:**
   - Allocate long-lived buffer, trigger rotation so `AllocEvent` is
     evicted, free the buffer, verify `FreeEvent.size` is non-zero.
7. **Concurrency (shuttle):**
   - Two threads sampling simultaneously, a thread freeing while
     another inserts, epoch advancement under contention.

---

## 12. Open questions

1. **Per-alloc allocator latency.** Wrapping `self.0.alloc` with a
   `clock_monotonic_ns` pair gives allocator latency for
   fragmentation investigations. Cost: +50 ns per sampled alloc. Easy
   to add as a field later with a lower sample rate (e.g. 4 MiB).

2. **MUSL / static builds.** The `safe_load` trampoline + SIGSEGV chain
   needs verification on musl. If unreliable, conditionally compile out
   the frame-pointer unwinder on musl targets and fall back to
   no-stack-capture mode.

3. **Multi-runtime selection.** With a single captured handle, all
   allocations land in one trace. If a service runs multiple dial9
   runtimes and wants per-runtime attribution, we'd need a different
   strategy. Punt until the use case is real.

4. **Dynamic ring-buffer sizing.** Today `ring_capacity` is fixed at
   install time. If sustained bursts exhaust the ring, the user bumps
   `ring_capacity` after seeing dropped-samples > 0. Auto-resize or
   per-thread overflow buffers are possible but not needed at default
   sample rates.

---

## 13. Known limitations

1. **`MAX_FRAME_SIZE` bias.** The unwinder stops walking if
   `saved_fp - fp > 256 KiB` (rejects wild pointers). For allocation
   profiling this bias is systematic — allocations inside functions
   with unusually large stack frames (large `Box::pin(future)` state
   machines, large `[u8; N]` locals) will consistently have truncated
   stacks. Plan: raise to 1 MiB with empirical validation of
   false-frame rate. Longer term, a variable-size ring buffer would
   allow capturing full stacks without a fixed frame cap.

2. **SIGSEGV handler ordering.** Applications that install their own
   SIGSEGV handler after dial9 initialization may break the unwinder's
   fault tolerance.

3. **Dealloc contention at extreme rates.** The free queue MPMC
   saturates at ~2.7 M pushes/sec aggregate. Services with 10M+
   deallocs/sec need a producer-side optimization (per-thread batch
   or bloom filter). Liveset is off by default for this reason.
